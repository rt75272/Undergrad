Debugging Log

DebuggerTest2:
	For DebuggerTest2 I started the 
	debugger with F11. At which point 
	the debugger menu threw an
	ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception. I  
	found the cause of this to be in the
	for loop. I changed the <= operator to
	a < operator. After making this change 
	the program successfully initialized the 
	fleet or cars. 
	
 FindRoute - Bug 1:
 	After pulling up the debugger menu and
 	cycling through the lines of code with
 	F5 and F6 I isolated the bug to be on 
 	line 41. The bug ended up being an 
 	extra semicolon attached to the end of
 	the while loop conditions parameter.
 	
 FindRoute - Bug 2:
 	The second bug was located in the 
 	Car class that the FindRoute class
 	was using. Using the debugger I found
 	the issue to be located in the nextMove()
 	method. Since the nextMove() method was 
 	taking too long to run I figured the 
 	incrementing must have been off. The bug 
 	ended up being an issue of the incrementer 
 	and decrementer being mixed up. The incrementer 
 	that was heading left needed to be switched
 	to head right, and vice versa. After switching 
 	the decrementer and the incrementer the program
 	was running correctly.
