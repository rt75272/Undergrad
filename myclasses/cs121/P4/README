# Project 4: TextStatistics 

* Author: Ryan Thompson
* Class: CS121
* Semester: Fall 2017

## Overview

This Java application takes a text file(s) and generates the 
statistics for the file. Statistics such as, word count, letter occurrences,
number of lines. 

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac ProcessText.java 
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java ProcessText file1 [file2â€¦]
```

You will be prompted for file names that you want to get the 
statistics for.

## Discussion

This project proved to be more challenging than the previous projects. 
Through some trial and error, I eventually got the code to start 
generating statistics for a text file. Once I got the code going the 
most challenging aspect was counting each individual letter occurrence. 
Counting the letters was not particularly difficult, just tricky. The 
trickiness of counting the letter was completed, with the use on an 
array and the use a for loops. 

## Testing

Once I got the code running and printing something I made sure to run
the code every time I made a significant edit. This allowed me to conduct
quick and generally effective edits without having to sift through all of 
my code. 

To test my code, I used the run configuration in eclipse to test the code 
quickly. For additional testing I ran the code from the command-line on 
my windows 10 computer. The code appeared to be working well in both of 
the testing situations
