# Project 3: Parking Finder

* Author: Ryan Thompson
* Class: CS121 Section 1
* Semester: Fall 2017

## Overview

This Java application takes user input and creates a 
random car location, along with four random parking spots.
Then the application determines which of the four 
randomly generated parking spots is closest to the car’s
location.

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main 
project directory:
```
$ javac ParkingFinder.java
$ javac ParkingSpot.java

```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java ParkingFinder

```

You will be prompted for numerical values to determine 
the range of the randomly generated automobile and 
parking spot locations. Afterwards you will be prompted
for the desired amount of time to park the automobile. 

## Discussion

In an effort to make my code more readable I spaced out 
the code for each section. Additionally, I added comments 
as a way to title each portion. Some of the comment 
titles include “Parking spot number”, “General setup”, 
and “Finding the closest parking spot”. The spacing and 
comment titles did help me sort through my code as I 
progressed with this project. Which did make edits much 
quicker and easier later on in the project. 

Linking class methods from the ParkingSpot.java file was 
a bit confusing at first. However, once I understood how 
to use the ParkingSpot methods in my ParkingFinder class 
I was off and rolling. I do like the newfound knowledge 
to link up two java files. I believe being able to break 
up my code into multiple files will be a useful skill on 
future coding adventures that are more strenuous. 

##Testing 

To avoid headaches towards the end of the project I 
tested the program every time I edited the code. This 
did prove to make edits quick and easy to implement. 
Once the program was complete I ran it in eclipse one 
last to make sure it ran good. In eclipse the program 
ran smoothly. To double check my program ran correctly, 
I ran the code in the command line. In the command line 
the program ran smoothly.
