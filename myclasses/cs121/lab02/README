Author: Ryan Thompson
Class: CS121L Section 1
Semester: Fall 2017


## Overview 

The ConvertToSeconds Java program takes three integers(hours, minutes, seconds) and 
converts them all to seconds. The ConvertToHours takes 3 integers as well and 
converts them to hours, in fractional/decimal form.


## Compiling and Using 


To compile ConvertToSeconds:

$ javac ConvertToSeconds.java

Run ConvertToSeconds:

$ java ConvertToSeconds


To compile ConvertToHours:

$ javac ConvertToHours.java

Run ConvertToHours:

$ java ConvertToHours


## Discussion

Overall the genesis of both ConvertToSeconds and ConvertToHours came together smoothly.


## Testing 

To make sure both ConvertToSeconds and ConvertToHours worked properly, I 
compiled and ran both of the programs. Both programs appear to be working 
properly.
