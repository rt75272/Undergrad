* Author: Ryan Thompson

* Semester: Fall 2017

## Overview

This Java application displays a car driving down a road, 
while an avatar fights to hover above the car.

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the directory:
```
$ javac TrafficAnimation.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java TrafficAnimation
```

## Discussion

Overall this project ran smoothly. Creating the 
shapes themselves was not extremely challenging.
The most challenging aspect of the project was 
positioning the new shapes, while keeping 
everything scaled correctly. The scale issue
was fixed by not hard coding any of the integer 
values. Instead the integer values are determined
by the user's screen width and height.

##Testing

To make sure my project ran correctly I ran it
almost every time I altered the code. Doing this
made sure I could fix something immediately. While
I was building the program I ran the project on 
eclipse to do the trial and error.
