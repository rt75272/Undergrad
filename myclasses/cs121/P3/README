# Project 3: Random Walk

* Author: Ryan Thompson
* Class: CS121 Section 1
* Semester: Fall 2017

## Overview

Creates a random walk with a final destination in mind. 
Uses methods to create the random walk.

.## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main 
project directory:
```
$ javac RandomWalk.java
$ javac RandomWalkTest.java
$ javac RandomWalkGUI.java
$ java GridMap.java
```
To display in the console
Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java RandomWalkTest.java
```
To display in the GUI
Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java RandomWalkGUI <integer gridSize> <integer seed>
```

## Discussion

Syncing up all the methods was the most time-consuming 
aspect of the project for me. At first, I got the 
methods to do anything, to see what they were doing. 
After some trial and error, I finally got the methods 
to produce the desired outcome.

Using the RandomWalkGUI was beneficial in trouble 
shooting the program. Being able to see what the 
program was doing make fixes quicker and easier to 
implement.

## Testing

To test my program, I ran it in eclipse after 
almost every edit. Once I figured out how to use 
the RandomWalkGUI.java file I used this as well to 
test my program. Testing often helped me correct 
errors before I reached the point where I forgot
what code I previously edited.
